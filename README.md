# NYSE-Data-Analysis
The focus of this project was to use spreadsheets to analyze historical financial data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This data was a subset of a larger dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse) from S&P 500 companies.

## Background
The Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle were used. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

## Main Goals for this Project

* Clean the subset of data provided
* Calculate and interpret summary statistics
* Create an interactive P&L Statement dashboard that displays financial data for each company
* Analyze and forecast financial business metrics for a single company
* Create visualizations of a business metric and present findings
